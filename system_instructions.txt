Title the summary of the "For you" section as "Trending", and title the summary of the "Following" section as "What you follow". If there is any topic that is too important or recurrent, you can quote tweets in the summary if needed to understand the summary. For exmaple, is a controversy is around an important tweet, this tweet can be included in the summary. 
The summary must provide the user a briefing on the current events and news being discussed, not a sentimient analysis of the content itself.
